# Smoothify

This project utilizes Spotify's API and neural networks from the Keras library to determine if a song is likely to enter Spotify's list of top 200 most streamed tracks by analyzing audio features.  Additional functionality includes determining if the track belongs on a user's playlist by running a similar analysis method.
